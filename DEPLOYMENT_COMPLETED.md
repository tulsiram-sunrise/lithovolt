## Warranty Claim Workflow - State Machine

The system now supports the complete warranty claim workflow:

```
PENDING
   ↓
[Assign to Staff Member] → UNDER_REVIEW
   ↓
[Approve] or [Reject]
   ├→ APPROVED
   └→ REJECTED
   ↓
[Resolve] → RESOLVED
```

Each transition is recorded in `ClaimStatusHistory` with:
- From/To status
- Changed by (user)
- Timestamp
- Optional notes

## Next Steps - Manual Testing

### Start Development Servers

**Terminal 1 - Django:**
```bash
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
# Server runs on http://localhost:8000
```

**Terminal 2 - Laravel:**
```bash
cd backend-laravel
php artisan serve --port=8001
# Server runs on http://localhost:8001
```

**Terminal 3 - React Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Dev server runs on http://localhost:5173
```

### Manual Test Sequence

1. **Navigate to Admin Panel:**
   - Go to http://localhost:5173/admin/warranty-claims
   - Login as company admin

2. **Verify Roles Page:**
   - Navigate to Roles admin page
   - ✓ Should show 4 roles (MANAGER, SUPPORT, SALES, TECH)
   - ✓ Should show staff count for each role

3. **Verify Permissions Page:**
   - Navigate to Permissions admin page
   - Select MANAGER role
   - ✓ Should show 14 permissions in matrix (checked)
   - Select SUPPORT role
   - ✓ Should show 8 permissions

4. **Verify Warranty Claims Workflow:**
   - Navigate to Warranty Claims page
   - Filter by PENDING status
   - ✓ Should see pending claims
   - Click "Assign" button on any claim
   - ✓ Modal opens with staff member dropdown
   - Select a staff member and submit
   - ✓ Claim status changes to UNDER_REVIEW
   - Click "Approve" button
   - ✓ Modal opens with notes field (optional)
   - Submit to approve
   - ✓ Claim status changes to APPROVED
   - Click "Resolve" button
   - ✓ Claim status changes to RESOLVED
   - Click claim to view details
   - ✓ Timeline shows all status transitions

5. **Test Reject Path (Alternative):**
   - Create a new claim or use different one
   - Assign to staff member
   - Click "Reject" button (NOT "Approve")
   - ✓ Modal opens with reason field
   - Submit
   - ✓ Claim status changes to REJECTED
   - Click "Resolve" button
   - ✓ Can resolve rejected claims too

6. **Verify Error Handling:**
   - Test permission add/remove on PermissionsPage
   - ✓ If API fails, error message should appear
   - ✓ UI state should rollback to previous state
